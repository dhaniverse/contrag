Before diving into stocks, make sure you have:
- Emergency savings (3-6 months expenses)
- Understanding of basic financial concepts
- Clear investment goals

In our game, try the stock market tutorial first! Start with blue-chip stocks (stable companies) and only invest money you can afford to lose. Remember, diversification is key - don't put all your rupees in one stock! 

Your next milestone could be unlocking the "First Investment" achievement. Keep learning! üìà`;

Looking at your profile focused on ${focus.toLowerCase()}, you're on the right track. For stock investing:

üéØ **Advanced Tips:**
- Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon
- Research P/E ratios, dividend yields, and company fundamentals  
- Think about sector diversification (tech, healthcare, finance, etc.)
- Regular rebalancing keeps your portfolio aligned with goals

Based on your progress, you might want to explore options trading or international diversification next. Your strong foundation means you can handle more complex strategies! Keep up the great work! üöÄ`;

From your game data, I can see your banking progress. Here's my advice:

üí∞ **Savings Strategy:**
- Aim to save 20% of your income (start with what you can!)
- Use high-yield savings accounts for better interest
- Consider fixed deposits for money you won't need soon
- Automate your savings to make it easier

The compound interest you mentioned is powerful - even small amounts grow significantly over time. In the game, try the Fixed Deposit feature to see this in action!

Your steady approach is building wealth the smart way. Next goal: unlock the "Interest Expert" achievement! üå±`;

**Your Next Learning Goals:**
${nextGoals}

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Complete any unfinished tutorials in your current area
2. Practice with the game's financial calculators
3. Try the scenario-based challenges for your level
4. Join multiplayer sessions to learn from other players

You're doing amazingly well with ${experience} XP! Your consistent progress shows you're truly understanding these concepts, not just memorizing them. That's the key to real financial literacy! 

Keep exploring and asking great questions! üåü`;

    // Default response for other questions

While I'd love to give you more specific advice based on your exact financial situation in the game, I can share some general wisdom:

üß† **Financial Learning Tips:**
- Take your time to understand each concept fully
- Practice with small amounts before making big decisions  
- Ask questions when something doesn't make sense
- Learn from both successes and mistakes

Your journey in financial literacy is unique, and every question you ask shows you're thinking critically about money management. That's the most important skill of all!

What specific aspect would you like to explore more deeply? I'm always here to help guide your learning! üöÄ`;
